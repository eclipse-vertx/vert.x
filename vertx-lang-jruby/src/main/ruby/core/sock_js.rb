  # This is an implementation of the server side part of {"https://github.com/sockjs"}
  #
  # SockJS enables browsers to communicate with the server using a simple WebSocket-like api for sending
  # and receiving messages. Under the bonnet SockJS chooses to use one of several protocols depending on browser
  # capabilities and what apppears to be working across the network.
  #
  # Available protocols include:
  #
  # WebSockets
  # xhr-polling
  # xhr-streaming
  # json-polling
  # event-source
  # html-file
  #
  # This means, it should just work irrespective of what browser is being used, and whether there are nasty
  # things like proxies and load balancers between the client and the server.
  #
  # For more detailed information on SockJS, see their website.
  #
  # On the server side, you interact using instances of {SockJSSocket} - this allows you to send data to the
  # client or receive data via the {ReadStream#data_handler}.
  #
  # You can register multiple applications with the same SockJSServer, each using different path prefixes, each
  # application will have its own handler, and configuration is described in a Hash.

  # You interact with SockJS clients through instances of SockJS socket.
  # The API is very similar to {WebSocket}. It implements both
  # {ReadStream} and {WriteStream} so it can be used with {Pump} to enable
  # flow control.
