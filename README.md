## What is vert.x?

**Vert.x is the framework for the next generation of asynchronous, effortlessly scalable, concurrent applications.**

Vert.x is a framework which takes inspiration from event driven frameworks like node.js, combines it with a distributed event bus and sticks it all on the JVM - a runtime with *real* concurrency and unrivalled performance. Vert.x then exposes the API in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, Groovy and Java.

Some of the key highlights include:

* Polyglot. Write your application components in JavaScript, CoffeeScript, Ruby, Python, Groovy or Java. It's up to you. Or mix and match
several programming languages in a single application. (Scala and Clojure support is scheduled too).

* No more worrying about concurrency. Vert.x allows you to write all your code as single threaded,
freeing you from the hassle of multi-threaded programming, yet unlike other asynchronous framework it scales seamlessly over available cores without you having to fork.

* Vert.x has a super simple, asynchronous programming model for writing truly scalable non-blocking applications.

* Vert.x includes a distributed event bus that spans the client and server side so your applications components can communicate incredibly easily. The event bus even penetrates into in-browser JavaScript allowing you to create effortless so-called *real-time* web applications.

* Vert.x provides real power and simplicity, without being simplistic. No more boilerplate or sprawling xml configuration files.

*If you don't want the whole vert.x platform, vert.x can also be used as a lightweight library in your Java or
Groovy applications*
