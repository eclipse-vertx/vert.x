## What is vert.x?

**Please note that the master branch is currently the development branch for Vert.x 3.0. For Vert.x 2, please see the 2.x branch**

**Explore the (experimental, work in progress) [Vert.x 3.0 web-site](http://vert-x3.github.io/)**

Vert.x is a polyglot, non-blocking, event-driven application platform that runs on the JVM.

Some of the key highlights include:

* Polyglot. You can write your application components in JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, Java or Python, and you can mix and match several programming languages in a single application.

* Simple *actor-like* concurrency model. Vert.x allows you to write all your code as single threaded, freeing you from many of the pitfalls of multi-threaded programming. (No more `synchronized`, `volatile` or explicit locking).

* Vert.x takes advantage of the JVM and scales seamlessly over available cores without having to manually fork multiple servers and handle inter process communication between them.

* Vert.x has a simple, asynchronous programming model for writing scalable non-blocking applications that can scale to 10s, 100s or even millions of concurrent connections using a minimal number of operating system threads.

* Vert.x includes a distributed event bus that spans the client and server side so your applications components can communicate easily. The event bus even penetrates into in-browser JavaScript allowing you to create effortless so-called *real-time* web applications.

* Vert.x provides real power and simplicity, without being simplistic. Configuration and boiler-plate is kept to a minimum.

* Vert.x includes a powerful module system and public module registry, so you can easily re-use and share Vert.x modules with others.

* Vert.x can be embedded in your existing Java applications.

**Please see the [Vert.x 2.x website](http://vertx.io/) for full documentation and information on Vert.x 2.x, which includes [project information](http://vertx.io/community.html)**

**This is the GitHub repository for the main Vert.x main project which is an Eclipse project. For any other parts of Vert.x 2.x projects that aren't in Eclipse please look at the [vert-x organisation](https://github.com/vert-x/) or for Vert.x 3.x projects please look at [vert-x3 organisation](https://github.com/vert-x3/)**

**Please use [Eclipse Bugzilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/enter_bug.cgi?product=Vertx) for any issues relating to the Vert.x main project (this project)**
