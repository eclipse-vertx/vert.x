    """This is an implementation of the server side part of https://github.com/sockjs

    SockJS enables browsers to communicate with the server using a simple WebSocket-like api for sending
    and receiving messages. Under the bonnet SockJS chooses to use one of several protocols depending on browser
    capabilities and what apppears to be working across the network.

    Available protocols include:

    WebSockets
    xhr-polling
    xhr-streaming
    json-polling
    event-source
    html-file

    This means, it should just work irrespective of what browser is being used, and whether there are nasty
    things like proxies and load balancers between the client and the server.

    For more detailed information on SockJS, see their website.

    On the server side, you interact using instances of SockJSSocket - this allows you to send data to the
    client or receive data via the ReadStream data_handler.

    You can register multiple applications with the same SockJSServer, each using different path prefixes, each
    application will have its own handler, and configuration is described in a Hash.
