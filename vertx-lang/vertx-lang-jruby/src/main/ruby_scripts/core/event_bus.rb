module Vertx

  # This class represents a distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple vert.x instances.
  # It is very useful for otherwise isolated vert.x application instances to communicate with each other.
  #
  # Messages sent over the event bus are JSON objects represented as Ruby Hash instances.
  #
  # The event bus implements both publish / subscribe network and point to point messaging.
  #
  # For publish / subscribe, messages can be published to an address using one of the publish methods. An
  # address is a simple String instance. Handlers are registered against an address. There can be multiple handlers
  # registered against each address, and a particular handler can be registered against multiple addresses.
  # The event bus will route a sent message to all handlers which are registered against that address.

  # For point to point messaging, messages can be sent to an address using the send method.
  # The messages will be delivered to a single handler, if one is registered on that address. If more than one
  # handler is registered on the same address, Vert.x will choose one and deliver the message to that. Vert.x will
  # aim to fairly distribute messages in a round-robin way, but does not guarantee strict round-robin under all
  # circumstances.
  #
  # All messages sent over the bus are transient. On event of failure of all or part of the event bus messages
  # may be lost. Applications should be coded to cope with lost messages, e.g. by resending them,
  # and making application services idempotent.
  #
  # The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender should match the order of messages
  # sent from that sender.
  #
  # When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver
  # has been received. Reply messages can also be replied to, etc, ad infinitum.
  #
  # Different event bus instances can be clustered together over a network, to give a single logical event bus.
  #
  # When receiving a message in a handler the received object is an instance of EventBus::Message - this contains
  # the actual Hash of the message plus a reply method which can be used to reply to it.
