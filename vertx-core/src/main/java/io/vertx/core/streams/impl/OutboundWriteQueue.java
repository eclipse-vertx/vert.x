/**
 * A concurrent multi producers back-pressured queue fronting a single consumer back-pressured system.
 *
 * The queue lets multiple producers emit elements ({@link #add}/{@link #submit}) to the consumer with back-pressure
 * to signal producers when they should stop emitting.
 *
 * <h3>Handling elements</h3>
 *
 * The consumer side uses a {@link Predicate} to handle elements and decide whether it can accept them. When a
 * consumer returns {@code false} it refuses the element and the queue will propose this element later when the
 * consumer signals it can accept elements again.
 *
 * <h3>Emitting elements</h3>
 *
 * Elements are emitted with {@link #add} and {@link #submit} methods.
 *
 * <h4>Adding elements</h4>
 *
 * Only the consumer thread can add elements. When the consumer threads adds an element to the queue it tries
 * to get the ownership of the queue and directly invoke the {@link #consumer}. When ownership
 * is not acquired, the element is added to the queue, until it is handled by the consumer thread later.
 *
 * <h4>Submitting elements</h4>
 *
 * When a producer thread submits an element to the queue, the element is added to the queue to let the consumer
 * thread handle it.
 *
 * <h3>Queue ownership</h3>
 *
 * Some operation require to <i>own</i> the queue to execute them. We already mentioned that {@link #add} and {@link #submit}
 * attempts to get ownership of the queue, sometimes these methods will not release ownership when they exit, because the queue
 * expects another thread or another condition to be met to make progress. Emitting methods can return a signal indicating that
 * the queue should be drained to make progress: {@link #DRAIN_REQUIRED_MASK} signals the queue contains element that
 * shall be drained.
 *
 * <h3>Draining elements</h3>
 *
 * The {@link #drain} method tries to remove elements from the queue until the consumer refuses them or the queue becomes empty.
 * When a method returns a {@link #DRAIN_REQUIRED_MASK} signal, the {@link #drain()} should be called by the consumer thread
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>A consumer method ({@link #add}, {@link #drain}) emits this signal when the {@link #consumer} refuses an element,
 *   therefore {@link #drain()} should be called when the consumer can accept element again</li>
 *   <li>A producer method ({@link #submit}) emits this signal when it acquired the ownership of the queue to {@link #drain} the
 *   queue.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Back-pressure</h3>
 *
 * <p>Producers emission flow cannot reliably be controlled by the consumer back-pressure probe since producers
 * emissions are transferred to the consumer thread: the consumer back-pressure controller does not take in account the
 * inflight elements between producers and consumer. This queue is designed to provide reliable signals to control
 * producers emission based on the consumer back-pressure probe and the number of inflight elements between
 * producers and the consumer.</p>
 *
 * The queue maintains an internal queue of elements initially empty and can be filled when
 * <ul>
 *   <li>producer threads {@link #submit)} to the queue above the {@link #highWaterMark}</li>
 *   <li>the {@link #consumer} refuses an element</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>When the internal queue grows above the {@link #highWaterMark}, the queue is considered as {@code unwritable}.
 * {@link #add}/{@link #submit} methods return {@link #QUEUE_UNWRITABLE_MASK} to signal producers should stop emitting.</p>
 *
 * <p>After a drain if the internal queue has shrunk under {@link #lowWaterMark}, the queue is considered as {@code writable}.
 * {@link #add}/{@link #drain} methods return {@link #QUEUE_WRITABLE_MASK} to signal producers should start emitting. Note
 * that the consumer thread handles this signal and should forward it to the producers.</p>
 *
 * <p>When {@link #QUEUE_WRITABLE_MASK} is signalled, the number of {@link #QUEUE_UNWRITABLE_MASK} signals emitted is encoded
 * in the flags. This number allows the producer flow controller to correctly account the producer writability:
 * {@link #QUEUE_WRITABLE_MASK}/{@link #QUEUE_UNWRITABLE_MASK} signals are observed by different threads, therefore a good
 * practice to compute the queue writability is to increment/decrement an atomic counter for each signal received.</p>
