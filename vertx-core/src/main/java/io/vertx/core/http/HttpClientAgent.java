/**
 * An asynchronous HTTP client.
 * <p>
 * It allows you to make requests to HTTP servers, and a single client can make requests to any server.
 * <p>
 * The client can also pool HTTP connections.
 * <p>
 * For pooling to occur, keep-alive must be true on the {@link io.vertx.core.http.HttpClientOptions} (default is true).
 * In this case connections will be pooled and re-used if there are pending HTTP requests waiting to get a connection,
 * otherwise they will be closed.
 * <p>
 * This gives the benefits of keep alive when the client is loaded but means we don't keep connections hanging around
 * unnecessarily when there would be no benefits anyway.
 * <p>
 * The client also supports pipe-lining of requests. Pipe-lining means another request is sent on the same connection
 * before the response from the preceding one has returned. Pipe-lining is not appropriate for all requests.
 * <p>
 * To enable pipe-lining, it must be enabled on the {@link io.vertx.core.http.HttpClientOptions} (default is false).
 * <p>
 * When pipe-lining is enabled the connection will be automatically closed when all in-flight responses have returned
 * and there are no outstanding pending requests to write.
 * <p>
 * The client is designed to be reused between requests.
