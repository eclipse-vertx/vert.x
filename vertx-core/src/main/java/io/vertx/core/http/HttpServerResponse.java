/**
 * Represents a server-side HTTP response.<p>
 * Instances of this class are created and associated to every instance of
 * {@link HttpServerRequest} that is created.<p>
 * It allows the developer to control the HTTP response that is sent back to the
 * client for a particular HTTP request. It contains methods that allow HTTP
 * headers and trailers to be set, and for a body to be written out to the response.<p>
 * It also allows files to be streamed by the kernel directly from disk to the
 * outgoing HTTP connection, bypassing user space altogether (where supported by
 * the underlying operating system). This is a very efficient way of
 * serving files from the server since buffers do not have to be read one by one
 * from the file and written to the outgoing socket.<p>
 * It implements {@link io.vertx.core.streams.WriteStream} so it can be used with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.streams.Pump} to pump data with flow control.<p>
 * Instances of this class are not thread-safe<p>
