/**
 * Represents a client-side HTTP request.<p>
 * Instances are created by an {@link HttpClient} instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 * specific HTTP methods, or the generic {@link HttpClient#request} method.<p>
 * Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once
 * you are ready to send the request, the {@link #end()} method should be called.<p>
 * Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The {@link HttpClient}
 * instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available in the pool. Any requests
 * sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent when an HTTP connection becomes
 * available from the pool.<p>
 * The headers of the request are actually sent either when the {@link #end()} method is called, or, when the first
 * part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.<p>
 * This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.<p>
 * It implements {@link io.vertx.core.streams.WriteStream} so it can be used with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.streams.Pump} to pump data with flow control.<p>
 * An example of using this class is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * HttpClientRequest req = httpClient.post("/some-url", new Handler&lt;HttpClientResponse&gt;() {
 *   public void handle(HttpClientResponse response) {
 *     System.out.println("Got response: " + response.statusCode);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * req.headers().put("some-header", "hello")
 *     .put("Content-Length", 5)
 *     .write(Buffer.newBuffer(new byte[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}))
 *     .write(Buffer.newBuffer(new byte[]{6, 7, 8, 9, 10}))
 *     .end();
 *
 * </pre>
 * Instances of HttpClientRequest are not thread-safe
