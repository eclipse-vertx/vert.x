/**
 * Represents a client-side HTTP request.
 * <p>
 * Instances are created by an {@link HttpClient} instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 * specific HTTP methods, or the generic request methods. On creation the request will not have been written to the
 * wire.
 * <p>
 * Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once
 * you are ready to send the request, one of the {@link #end()} methods should be called.
 * <p>
 * Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection.
 * <p>
 * The {@link HttpClient} instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP
 * connections available in the pool. Any requests sent before a connection is assigned will be queued
 * internally and actually sent when an HTTP connection becomes available from the pool.
 * <p>
 * The headers of the request are queued for writing either when the {@link #end()} method is called, or, when the first
 * part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.
 * <p>
 * This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.
 * <p>
 * It implements {@link io.vertx.core.streams.WriteStream} so it can be used with
 * {@link io.vertx.core.streams.Pipe} to pipe data with flow control.
 * <p>
 * An example of using this class is as follows:
