TODO
====
1) Consider wrapping libev in Java API
2) Consider using disruptor https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/ as alternative to concurrent queues
3) SSL exceptions aren't very nice
4) StartTLS
5) endHandler handlers not currently being called - check this
6) Websocket close protocol
7) Synchronous versions of filesystem ops ??
8) Filesystem lock + watch
9) Javadoc
10) Ruby doc
12) Netty needs to implement event loop
13) HTTP server side 100-continue handling
15) Netty should build timers into event loop
19) Make Java vertx methods static ??
20) Package manager and deployment
21) HTTPClient should pool HTTP connections in same way as redis client, i.e. have HTTPPool and HTTPConnection class -
otherwise can't do proper pipelining since can't guarantee same connection.

For people who don't care about pipelining, then all the request methods should ALSO live on the pool - this is a
shortcut to writing .connection() and clos()ing each time

Websockets should also be obtained immediately from a call to websocket() on the HTTPPool class, this will return
a ClientWebsocket instance, which will try and connect() immediately. If anything is written before being connected
it will go into a pending list, like with HttpClientRequest

22) Per thread connection pools. If we can have multiple connection pools, one for each core thread then they don't
need any synchronization.
23) HTTP connection reconnection.
24) Look at Redis cluster support in client
25) Core JSON support
26) Websockets connection close protocol
