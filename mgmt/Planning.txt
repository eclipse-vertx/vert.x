TODO
====
1) Consider wrapping libev in Java API
2) Consider using disruptor https://code.google.com/p/disruptor/ as alternative to concurrent queues
3) SSL exceptions aren't very nice
4) StartTLS
5) endHandler handlers not currently being called - check this
6) Websocket close protocol
7) Synchronous versions of filesystem ops
8) Filesystem lock + watch
9) Javadoc
10) Ruby doc
12) Netty needs to implement event loop
13) HTTP server side 100-continue handling
14) Allow to set HTTP response reason
15) Netty should build timers into event loop
16) More tests needed!
19) Make Java nodex methods static
20) Package manager and deployment
21) HTTPClient should pool HTTP connections in same way as redis client, i.e. have HTTPPool and HTTPConnection class -
otherwise can't do proper pipelining since can't guarantee same connection.
