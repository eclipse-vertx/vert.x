/**
 * A distributed lightweight event bus which can encompass multiple vert.x instances.
 * The event bus implements a distributed publish / subscribe network.<p>
 *
 * Messages sent over the event bus can be all primitive types, {@code String}. {@code Buffer}, or {@code Map} representing a JSON object.<p>
 *
 * Messages can be sent to an address. An address is a simple {@code String} instance. Handlers are registered against
 * an address. There can be multiple handlers registered against each address, and a particular handler can
 * be registered against multiple addresses. The event bus will route a sent message to any handlers which are
 * registered against that address.<p>
 * Messages received in a handler are instances of {@link Message}<p>
 * All messages sent over the bus are transient. On event of failure of all or part of the event bus messages
 * may be lost. Applications should be coded to cope with lost messages, e.g. by resending them, and making application
 * services idempotent.<p>
 *
 * The order of messages received by any specific handler from a specific sender should match the order of messages
 * sent from that sender.<p>
 *
 * When sending a message, a reply handler can be provided. If so, it will be called when the reply from the receiver
 * has been received. Reply messages can also be replied to, etc, ad infinitum<p>
 *
 * Different event bus instances can be clustered together over a network, to give a single logical event bus.<p>
