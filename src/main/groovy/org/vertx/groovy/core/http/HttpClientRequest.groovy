/**
 * Represents a client-side HTTP request.<p>
 * Instances of this class are created by an {@link HttpClient} instance, via one of the methods corresponding to the
 * specific HTTP methods, or the generic {@link HttpClient#request} method.<p>
 * Once a request has been obtained, headers can be set on it, and data can be written to its body if required. Once
 * you are ready to send the request, the {@code #end()} method should be called.<p>
 * Nothing is actually sent until the request has been internally assigned an HTTP connection. The {@link HttpClient}
 * instance will return an instance of this class immediately, even if there are no HTTP connections available in the pool. Any requests
 * sent before a connection is assigned will be queued internally and actually sent when an HTTP connection becomes
 * available from the pool.<p>
 * The headers of the request are actually sent either when the {@code #end()} method is called, or, when the first
 * part of the body is written, whichever occurs first.<p>
 * This class supports both chunked and non-chunked HTTP.<p>
 * It implements {@link WriteStream} so it can be used with
 * {@link org.vertx.java.core.streams.Pump} to pump data with flow control.<p>
 * Instances of this class are not thread-safe<p>
 * An example of using this class is as follows:
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 *
 * def req = httpClient.post("/some-url") { response ->
 *   println "Got response: ${response.statusCode}"
 * }
 *
 * req.putHeader("some-header", "hello")
 * req.putHeader("Content-Length", 5)
 * req.write << buffer
 * req.write << "some-string"
 * req.end()
 *
 * </pre>
 *
 * The headers are also accessible as a {@code Map} so you can use index notation to access them.
