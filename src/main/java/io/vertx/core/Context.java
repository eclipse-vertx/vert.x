/**
 * The execution context of a {@link io.vertx.core.Handler} execution.
 * <p>
 * When Vert.x provides an event to a handler or calls the start or stop methods of a {@link io.vertx.core.Verticle},
 * the execution is associated with a {@code Context}.
 * <p>
 * Usually a context is an *event-loop context* and is tied to a specific event loop thread. So executions for that
 * context always occur on that exact same event loop thread.
 * <p>
 * In the case of worker verticles and running inline blocking code a worker context will be associated with the execution
 * which will use a thread from the worker thread pool.
 * <p>
 * When a handler is set by a thread associated with a specific context, the Vert.x will guarantee that when that handler
 * is executed, that execution will be associated with the same context.
 * <p>
 * If a handler is set by a thread not associated with a context (i.e. a non Vert.x thread). Then a new context will
 * be created for that handler.
 * <p>
 * In other words, a context is propagated.
 * <p>
 * This means that when a verticle is deployed, any handlers it sets will be associated with the same context - the context
 * of the verticle.
 * <p>
 * This means (in the case of a standard verticle) that the verticle code will always be executed with the exact same
 * thread, so you don't have to worry about multi-threaded acccess to the verticle state and you can code your application
 * as single threaded.
 * <p>
 * This class also allows arbitrary data to be {@link #put} and {@link #get} on the context so it can be shared easily
 * amongst different handlers of, for example, a verticle instance.
 * <p>
 * This class also provides {@link #runOnContext} which allows an action to be executed asynchronously using the same context.
