/**
 * == Record Parser
 * <p>
 * The record parser allows you to easily parse protocols which are delimited by a sequence of bytes, or fixed
 * size records. It transforms a sequence of input buffer to a sequence of buffer structured as configured (either
 * fixed size or separated records).
 * <p>
 * For example, if you have a simple ASCII text protocol delimited by '\n' and the input is the following:
 * <p>
 * [source]
 * ----
 * buffer1:HELLO\nHOW ARE Y
 * buffer2:OU?\nI AM
 * buffer3: DOING OK
 * buffer4:\n
 * ----
 * <p>
 * The record parser would produce
 * [source]
 * ----
 * buffer1:HELLO
 * buffer2:HOW ARE YOU?
 * buffer3:I AM DOING OK
 * ----
 * <p>
 * Let's see the associated code:
 * <p>
 * [source, $lang]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.RecordParserExamples#example1()}
 * ----
 * <p>
 * You can also produce fixed sized chunks as follows:
 * <p>
 * [source, $lang]
 * ----
 * {@link examples.RecordParserExamples#example2()}
 * ----
 * <p>
 * For more details, check out the {@link io.vertx.core.parsetools.RecordParser} class.
