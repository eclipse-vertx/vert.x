/**
 * A verticle is a piece of code that can be deployed by Vert.x.
 * <p>
 * Use of verticles with Vert.x is entirely optional, but if you use them they provide an <i>actor-like</i>
 * deployment and concurrency model, out of the box.
 * <p>
 * Vert.x does not provide a strict actor implementation, but there are significant similarities.
 * <p>
 * You can think of verticle instances as a bit like actors in the Actor Model. A typical verticle-based Vert.x application
 * will be composed of many verticle instances in each Vert.x instance.
 * <p>
 * The verticles communicate with each other by sending messages over the {@link io.vertx.core.eventbus.EventBus}.
