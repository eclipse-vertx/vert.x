/**
 *
 * This is an implementation of the server side part of <a href="https://github.com/sockjs">SockJS</a><p>
 *
 * <p>SockJS enables browsers to communicate with the server using a simple WebSocket-like api for sending
 * and receiving messages. Under the bonnet SockJS chooses to use one of several protocols depending on browser
 * capabilities and what apppears to be working across the network.<p>
 *
 * Available protocols include:<p>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>WebSockets</li>
 *   <li>xhr-polling</li>
 *   <li>xhr-streaming</li>
 *   <li>json-polling</li>
 *   <li>event-source</li>
 *   <li>html-file</li>
 * </ul><p>
 *
 * This means, it should <i>just work</i> irrespective of what browser is being used, and whether there are nasty
 * things like proxies and load balancers between the client and the server.<p>
 *
 * For more detailed information on SockJS, see their website.<p>
 *
 * On the server side, you interact using instances of {@link SockJSSocket} - this allows you to send data to the
 * client or receive data via the {@link SockJSSocket#dataHandler}.<p>
 *
 * You can register multiple applications with the same SockJSServer, each using different path prefixes, each
 * application will have its own handler, and configuration.<p>
